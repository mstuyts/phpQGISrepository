  "body": "# phpQGISrepository\r\nphpQGISrepository is a simple PHP script to create a repository for [QGIS](http://qgis.org) Python plugins.\r\n\r\n## Good to know\r\n* The script has **no settings**.\r\n* The script is **ready to go**.\r\n* The script needs **no database**.\r\n* As long as your server can handle **PHP**-scripts you can use this both on the internet as on an intranet.\r\n* Make sure the **metadata.txt** is filled in correct in the QGIS Python Plugin zip-files.\r\n\r\n## Why would I need my own repository?\r\n* If you plan to share your plugins with the worldwide QGIS community, **you don't need it**. In that case use the official [QGIS Python Plugins Repository](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml).\r\n* If you make plugins that are only intended for a limited number of QGIS users, **you can use this simple script** to create your own repository. \r\n\r\n## How to install\r\n* Upload all files from  this Github repository to your server that can handle PHP scripts.\r\n* Upload your valid QGIS Python Plugin zip-files to the 'downloads' subfolder. It already contains an example plugin. You can delete this example if you want.\r\n* Have a drink and enjoy your newly installed repository.\r\n\r\n## How to use your repository\r\n* In your browser go to the url of the main folder you installed the script in. (This is the same url you should add in QGIS)\r\n* Add the repository to QGIS: \"Plugins\" - \"Manage and install plugins...\" - \"Settings\" - \"Add...\". (If you make QGIS plugins you probably already knew where to add a custom repository)\r\n\r\n## Did you make some customisations to the plugins.xsl file?\r\n* Add them with an alternative name like *plugins_example_flashygreen.xsl* to this Github repository as an example for other users.\r\n\r\n## How do you make a plugin?\r\n* More information can be found at http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins.html.\r\n\r\n",
